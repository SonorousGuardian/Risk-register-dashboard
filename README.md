# ðŸ“Š Risk Register Dashboard with Streamlit

This project is a comprehensive, single-file web application for Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) management. Built with Python and Streamlit, it transforms a standard risk register from a CSV or Excel file into a dynamic, interactive dashboard.

The dashboard is designed to provide a clear, data-driven overview of an organization's risk landscape, making it easier for teams to analyze, prioritize, and manage risks effectively.

## âœ¨ Key Features

  * **Upload Your Data**: Easily upload your own risk register in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format.
  * **Dynamic KPI Cards**: At-a-glance metrics for Total Risks, Open Risks, Average Likelihood, and Average Impact that update instantly with filters.
  * **Advanced Risk Matrix**: A 5x5 colored grid heatmap that displays the *count* of risks for each Impact vs. Likelihood combination.
  * **Interactive Visualizations**:
      * **Treemap** to visualize the distribution of risk scores across different risk categories.
      * **Donut Chart** to show the current status of all filtered risks (e.g., Open, Mitigated).
  * **Powerful Filtering**: A comprehensive sidebar allows you to filter the entire dashboard by:
      * Risk Owner
      * Risk Category
      * Status
      * Last Updated Date Range
      * Risk Score Range
  * **Data Export**: Download the currently filtered data to an Excel file with a single click for reporting.
